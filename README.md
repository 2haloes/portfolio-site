# My portfolio website
The codebase of my lightweight portfolio website

This website is designed to show the work I've done and what I can do, designed to load and run as quickly as I can make it to show to possible employers.

As a challenge to myself, I am doing everything possible without using Javascript. This is so I can both keep this site running as smooth as possible and also to help improve my CSS skills.

The animation showing my years of experience was created using Inkscape to create the base vector (creating text and then converting that text to paths) and [svgator](https://www.svgator.com/) to animate the movements

Items in the assets/not_free directory are used for informative purposes and were not created by myself.
The Access Group logo belongs to The Access Group, the vector used was found [here](https://seeklogo.com/vector-logo/317020/the-access-group) and was converted into an SVG file using Inkscape
The screenshot of the Plan app is owned by Milestoned LLC and was taken from the app's [Windows store page](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nblggh4vhbw?hl=en-gb&gl=GB)
The server icon was [found here](https://publicdomainvectors.org/en/free-clipart/Vector-drawing-of-one-red-server-icon/26773.html) and edited myself to fit the site theme. Note that the source linked on the website leads to a website no longer active.

To reduce file sizes [SVGOMG](https://svgomg.net/) is used on the SVG files (originals have been kept in the assets folder) and [tinify](https://tinypng.com/) is used on the other image files

For accessibility, I used the [WAVE evaluation browser extension](https://wave.webaim.org/) to find and fix issues, as of 2024-04-11 this has returned no errors or alerts
